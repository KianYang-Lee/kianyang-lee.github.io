	I'm a web app developer that lives in Malaysia that likes sports and outdoor activities. Also
	likes sushi, udon, tempura and other varieties of Japanese food.
</p>
<p>
	I speak English, Mandarin, Cantonese, and Malay. One of these days am going to learn Japanese too.
	Language is lovely as learning a new language opens up door for possibilities.
</p>
<p>
	Oh you curious about what <span>language</span> that I use in my work? Mostly Java, Typescript and
	Golang.
</p>
<p>
	Aside from development work, I blog on various topics, including how to build something using
	different languages. You can find some of my most recent blogs below.
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
